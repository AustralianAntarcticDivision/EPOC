		# Function:           B.MI.Es.KPFM.update_State.01
		# Version             0.01
		# Description:        update the State of the element in each polygon
		#                     based on the Transition part of the environment
		#                     All parts of transition are read (except for consumption)
		#                     and the State is updated accordingly.  Consumption is dealt with directly
		#
		#                     If there is insufficient abundance then an error routine is invoked to make the
		#                     abundance equal to zero and to modify the amounts taken out of the polygon such as
		#                     predator consumption amongst other corrections (migration corrections are not included at present)
		# Notes               all $Mortality records should be in the abundance units relevant to the specific polygon
		#                         it is assumed that conversion from one unit to another has been achieved elsewhere
		#                         an error will be recorded if this is not the case
		#                     have not taken account of potentially different size conditions in different polygons and how
		#                         these will combine to give an appropriate value for B/N.
		#   Elements using this function
